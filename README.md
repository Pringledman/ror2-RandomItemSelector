# ror2-RandomItemSelector
Made this for a gamemode in Risk of Rain 2 my friends and I came up with.

# Gamemode rules
COMMAND ARTIFACT REQUIRED.
Each player is given a single random item for each rarity per round. Open chests as normal but each player must stack the random items given at the beginning of the stage.

Example:
Player1's items:

White: Bundle of Fireworks
Green: Chronobauble
Red: Wake of Vultures
Gold: Queen's Gland

Player1 opens a chest and a green item is dropped, Player1 must choose Chronobauble. Player1 opens another 2 chests dropping a green and white item, Player1 must continue stacking Chronobauble and choose Bundle of Fireworks.
